# BA Portfolio -  Job Search Journey
Welcome to my Business Analysis Portfolio repository. This collection showcases a comprehensive set of business analysis artifacts and methodologies employed to document and optimise my journey in securing a Business Analyst position. It demonstrates my analytical skills, process improvement capabilities, and commitment to data-driven decision-making in a real-world context.
